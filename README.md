# CognitoSample-ios
Basic native iOS app written in objective-c to use the AWS SDK for authentication using the Cognito service.  App is a single ViewController with (3) buttons to: login, refresh, and logout. Configuration data and username/password has been stripped out.  So, users will need to create their own Cognito UserPool, ClientID, IdentityPool and provide the information to run the app.
